# Prospective Customer Identification Using Census Data

## Project Summary
Applies advanced data science techniques to identify potential customers from the 1994 U.S. Census data. Using a combination of machine learning algorithms and big data technologies, we aim to enhance targeting strategies for businesses.

## Objectives
Our main objective is to determine potential customers based on demographic and economic indicators provided by the Census data. The project employs statistical analysis and predictive modeling to find patterns and predict customer behavior.

## Data Source
The dataset originates from the [U.S. Census database](http://www.census.gov/ftp/pub/DES/www/welcome.html), which includes comprehensive information on various attributes such as age, workclass, education, marital status, occupation, and income.

## Technical Overview
### Data Processing
- **Data Extraction**: Automated scripts to pull data directly from the Census Bureauâ€™s FTP site.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and anomalies in categorical and numerical data.

### Feature Engineering
- **Transformation**: Application of One-Hot Encoding on categorical data.
- **Selection**: Use of feature importance scores from preliminary models to select significant features.

### Modeling
- **Model Training**: Various algorithms tested including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Ensemble Methods.
- **Validation**: Performance measured using confusion matrix metrics (True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, False Negatives).
- **Optimization**: Hyperparameter tuning using grid search and randomized search techniques, parallelized with Apache Spark to handle large-scale data.

### Data Flow
The data flow diagram included in the repository illustrates the entire process from data extraction to model deployment.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Data Imbalance**: Implemented synthetic data generation techniques.
- **Scalability**: Utilized Apache Spark for distributed data processing and model training.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Applied both grid search and randomized search strategies to find the optimal model settings.

## Future Directions
- **Feature Expansion**: Integrate more socio-economic factors to enhance model accuracy.
- **Algorithm Enhancement**: Explore more sophisticated algorithms like XGBoost or neural networks.
- **Application Scope**: Extend to a regression framework to estimate the probability of customer conversion.

## Usage
The repository contains all code and detailed instructions for setting up the environment, executing the data preprocessing scripts, running the models, and evaluating their performance.
